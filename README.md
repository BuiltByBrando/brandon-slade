<p>I'm interested in the future, new ways to communicate, ground breaking innovations, and life long learning.
I am currently a Web App Dev student looking to find home in the right company.
I'm fluent in CSS HTML and some adobe programs (Premier, Illustrator, Photoshop, After Effects).
In the next little while I will focus my learnins on stuff like php ruby java etc..
You can contact me at BrandonASlade@gmail.com if you are in need of a new and eager junior dev.</p>
